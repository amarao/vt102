Welcome to vt102's documentation!
=================================

``vt102`` is an in memory vt102 terminal emulator. It supports all the
most common terminal escape sequences, including text attributes and
color.

Why would you want to use a terminal emulator?

* Screen scraping some terminal or curses app.
* Chicks dig dudes with terminals.
* ... seriously, that's about it.

Usage
=====

There are two important classes in ``vt102``:
:class:`vt102.screens.Screen` and :class:`vt102.streams.Stream`. The
``Screen`` is the terminal screen emulator. It maintains an in-memory
buffer of text and text-attributes to display on screen. The ``Stream``
is the stream processor. It manages the state of the input and dispatches
events to anything that's listening about things that are going on.
Events are things like ``linefeed``, ``draw "a"``, or ``cursor-position 10,10``.
See the :ref:`API <api>` for more details.

In general, if you just want to know what's being displayed on screen you
can do something like the following:

    >>> import vt102
    >>> stream = vt102.Stream()
    >>> screen = vt102.Screen(80, 24)
    >>> screen.attach(stream)
    >>> stream.feed(u"\u001b7\u001b[?47h\u001b)0\u001b[H\u001b[2J\u001b[H"
