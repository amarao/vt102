Welcome to vt102's documentation!
=================================

What is ``vt102``? It's an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator.
*XXX* stands for a series video terminals, developed by
`DEC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation>`_ between
1970 and 1995. The first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100
terminal, which is now a de-facto standard for all virtual terminal
emulators. ``vt102`` follows the suit.

So, why would one need a terminal emulator library?

* To screen scrape terminal apps, for example ``htop`` or ``aptitude``.
* To write cross platform terminal emulators; either with a graphical
  (`xterm <http://invisible-island.net/xterm/>`_,
  `rxvt <http://www.rxvt.org/>`_) or a web interface, like
  `AjaxTerm <http://antony.lesuisse.org/software/ajaxterm/>`_.
* To have fun, hacking on the ancient, poorly documented technologies.

Usage
=====

There are two important classes in ``vt102``:
:class:`vt102.screens.Screen` and :class:`vt102.streams.Stream`. The
``Screen`` is the terminal screen emulator. It maintains an in-memory
buffer of text and text-attributes to display on screen. The ``Stream``
is the stream processor. It manages the state of the input and dispatches
events to anything that's listening about things that are going on.
Events are things like ``linefeed``, ``draw "a"``, or ``cursor-position 10,10``.
See the :ref:`API <api>` for more details.

In general, if you just want to know what's being displayed on screen you
can do something like the following:

    >>> import vt102
    >>> stream = vt102.Stream()
    >>> screen = vt102.Screen(80, 24)
    >>> screen.attach(stream)
    >>> stream.feed(u"\u001b7\u001b[?47h\u001b)0\u001b[H\u001b[2J\u001b[H"
