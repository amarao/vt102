    ~~~~~

    `vt102` implements a mix of VT102, VT220 and VT520 specification,
    an aims to support most of the `TERM=linux` functionality.

    Two classes: :class:`vt102.Stream`, which parses the command stream
    and dispatches events for commands, and :class:`vt102.Screen` which,
    when used with a `Stream` maintains a buffer of strings representing
    the screen of a terminal.
