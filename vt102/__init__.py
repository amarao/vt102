    ~~~~~

    `vt102` implements a subset of the vt102 specification (the subset
    that should be most useful for use in software).

    Two classes: :class:`stream`, which parses the command stream and
    dispatches events for commands, and :class:`screen` which, when used
    with a `stream` maintains a buffer of strings representing the screen
    of a terminal.
