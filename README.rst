About
-----

What is ``vt102``? It's an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator.
*XXX* stands for a series video terminals, developed by
`DEC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation>`_ between
1970 and 1995. The first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100
terminal, which is now a de-facto standard for all virtual terminal
emulators. ``vt102`` follows the suit.

So, why would one need a terminal emulator library?

* To screen scrape terminal apps, for example ``htop`` or ``aptitude``.
* To write cross platform terminal emulators; either with a graphical
  (`xterm <http://invisible-island.net/xterm/>`_,
  `rxvt <http://www.rxvt.org/>`_) or a web interface, like
  `AjaxTerm <http://antony.lesuisse.org/software/ajaxterm/>`_.
* To have fun, hacking on the ancient, poorly documented technologies.


Installation
------------

If you have `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_
you can use ``easy_install -U vt102``. Otherwise, you can download the source
from `GitHub <http://github.com/samfoo/vt102>`_ and run ``python setup.py install``.


Example
-------

    >>> import vt102
    >>> screen = vt102.Screen(80, 24)
    >>> stream = vt102.Stream()
    >>> stream.attach(screen)
    >>> stream.feed(u"\u001b7\u001b[?47h\u001b)0\u001b[H\u001b[2J\u001b[H"
